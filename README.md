## Preface <a name="preface"></a>

By joining the Gentooverse community, you agree to follow this Code of Conduct as it exists at the time of joining â€” and as it is updated over time. You also agree to comply with Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)<!-- (if on the Discord server) and with Revolt's [Terms of Service](https://revolt.chat/legal/terms) (if on the Revolt server)-->. Failure to comply may result in your removal from our community.

---

## Section 1 - General Community Policies <a name="section-1---general-community-policies"></a>

These policies ensure a safe and respectful environment for all our members.

### 1.1 - Discrimination <a name="11---discrimination"></a>

We do not tolerate any form of discrimination based on a person's gender, sexuality, race, religion, ethnicity,
nationality, language, age, body size, and other aspects of their identity. Our community is inclusive, and any
discriminatory actions may result in moderation action, depending on severity.

---

### 1.2 - Age Requirements <a name="12---age-requirements"></a>

By joining Gentooverse, you must be of the legal age in your jurisdiction to use our platforms. For Discord, you can review the conditions [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040724612-Why-is-Discord-asking-for-my-birthday)<!-- Whereas for Revolt, you can review the conditions [here.](https://support.revolt.chat/kb/safety/minimum-age-guidelines)-->. Generally, you must be over 13, if users are found underage they will have their access to Gentooverse, and potentially partnered servers, revoked for at minimum 2 years.

---

### 1.3 - Safe for Work Environment <a name="13---safe-for-work-environment"></a>

We aim to maintain a Safe For Work (SFW) space for everyone. This includes guidelines for all forms of shared content:

#### 1.3.1 - Sexually Explicit Messages
- All messages must be safe for work. Explicit content (written, visual, auditory, or any other form) is prohibited.

#### 1.3.2 - Inappropriate User Profiles
- Profile content must remain appropriate for a community that includes minors, and adults. It cannot be
  sexually explicit, and/or hateful towards individuals/groups that are generally considered to be not harmful for
  society. Although you can have your own opinion about who's harmful or not, we will follow the widely accepted
  standards of society to define what's harmful or not.

#### 1.3.3 - Animal Abuse, Gore, and Excessive Violence
- Do not share content depicting animal abuse, graphic gore, or excessive violence.

#### 1.3.4 - Self-Harm and Suicide
- Content related to self-harm or suicide is not allowed. Using such topics in a manipulative/negative
  way will result in immediate removal. We would also recommend not talking about these topics, because it might trigger
  someone that are facing the same issues in their own life, or they have someone close that has/had dealt with issues
  like this in the past.

---

### 1.4 - Anti-Elitism <a name="14---anti-elitism"></a>

Elitist behavior is not acceptable. Dismissing newcomers with comments like "RTFM" or "Read the Fucking Manual" undermines our community spirit. Additionally, knocking people for using certain distributions (eg. Ubuntu, Manjaro, Fedora or others) is not tolerated as we have a policy of welcoming all regardless of distribution.

---

### 1.5 - Personally Identifiable Information <a name="15---personally-identifiable-information"></a>

Do not share personal information about others (e.g., real names, phone numbers, emails, addresses) without explicit consent. Doing so may result in immediate removal from the community.

---

### 1.6 - Discussion of Piracy <a name="16---discussion-of-piracy"></a>

While discussions around piracy may occur, promoting or sharing sources, resources, or links related to piracy is prohibited. A moderator reserves the right to withdraw from a conversation, withhold a conversation or stop a conversation regarding this topic at any time. Failure to stop when asked will result in punishment.

---

### 1.7 - Bot Commands <a name="17---bot-commands"></a>

Please use designated channels for bot commands to ensure clear conversation flow. You cannot abuse bots by repeatedly spamming the bot commands, as that will not only flood chat, but may have a negative impact on the bots performance affecting other members.

---

### 1.8 - Harassment of Members <a name="18---harassment-of-members"></a>
Harrassing members in server or in DMs is not tolerated. We will not accept malicious interactions with a member and if you do so, we reserve the right to remove you from the server. Making slanderous accusations against members also falls under this rule.

---

### 1.9 - Low Quality Content <a name="19---low-quality-content"></a>

Low Quality content is content which adds little fruition to chat, e.g. spamming cat GIFs or similar. This does not ban them all together.

We ask that you attempt to keep chat quality to a degree of "quality" - this does not mean you need technical discussion, what you do need however is to just keep some form of sensicality to the chat room.

e.g.: Instead of spamming cat GIFs, put a cat GIF and say something of fruition to the conversation regarding it too.

---

## Section 2 - Voice Activity Conduct <a name="section-2---voice-activity-conduct"></a>

Voice channels have more relaxed guidelines but still require respectful behavior.

### 2.1 - Music Bot Trolling <a name="21---music-bot-trolling"></a>

Interrupting music sessions (e.g., mass skipping or altering the queue) is not allowed. Please wait your turn or use a separate voice channel.

---

### 2.2 - Sound Spam <a name="22---sound-spam"></a>

Spamming soundboard clips or audio in voice channels disrupts conversation and is prohibited. It may result in being server muted or removed from the voice channel.

---

### 2.3 - Streamed Content <a name="23---streamed-content"></a>

All streamed content must comply with our SFW policies and piracy guidelines. Streaming content you haven't legally purchased is not allowed and may result in removal from the community.

---

## Section 3 - Moderation Policies <a name="section-3---moderation-policies"></a>

By joining Gentooverse, you acknowledge our moderation practices.

### 3.1 - Moderator Discretion <a name="31---moderator-discretion"></a>

Moderators have the authority to remove members for valid reasons. However, you have the right to communicate if you disagree with a decision using our ticketing system. Moderators must exercise their discretion fairly.

---

### 3.2 - Moderation Transparency <a name="32---moderation-transparency"></a>

All moderation logs are publicly viewable to maintain transparency. If you have concerns or need clarifications, please open a ticket rather than discussing in general channels.

---

### 3.3 - Moderator Unsuitability <a name="33---moderator-unsuitability"></a>

If the community deems a moderator unfit, a public vote will be held. A 30-day transition period is provided during which the outgoing administrator remains until a successor is elected. For this process to proceed, at least **2/3 of the ENTIRE community** must agree via poll.

---

### 3.4 - Moderator Privilege <a name="34---moderator-privilege"></a>

Moderators may remove any member deemed unfit for the community, even if they are following the Code of Conduct. This power is not absolute and can be challenged. However, sensitive matters may require administrators to withhold specific details.

---

## Licensing <a name="licensing"></a>
